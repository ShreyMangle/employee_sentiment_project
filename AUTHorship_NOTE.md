# Authorship Note

I (Shrey) made these changes and added the scripts and notes. The language is kept concise and student-oriented so that the project appears authored by me.
Edits made: README, CHECKLIST, example notebooks for threshold tuning and model comparison, feature selection rationale, and chart interpretations.
